##And this is how it looks?
~~I don't know~~ I do know now
*is this anything?* so italics are one star
**is THIS anything?** and bold is with two
***what about this tho?*** okay, 3=2+1
and _underscores_ make the same as one star
and __double underscore__ is like two
___triple underscore?___ yup, three stars
____four?____ why would we want ****four****?

underlining seems to do the same big size as the ##
---

and any amount of underlining is enough
---
---
just making the underlines under a blank line, though, makes a horizontal rule!

*------------------------------------------* stars do make it darker, but only ~~exactly as many as you type~~ more like the length of it? roughly? the stars seem to actually make the size of the dashes bigger...
**------** huh, it went from 6 dashes to 2 long ones
*----* **----** ***----*** ****----**** interesting.
*number of stars do seem to do the same to dashes as to letters, except that the number of dashes changes...*

I wonder if there's a way to do superscript, like <sup>Avery</sup> suggested - huh, okay, it has to be a formal tag I guess, "sup" in brackets. So probably "sub" <sub>in brackets</sub> works also - aha!

But what about other html tags? <i>italics</i> or <b>bold</b> do happen with *i* and **b** but I think the star and double star are easier!

This is entertaining, but I think I'd rather move to the html practice.
